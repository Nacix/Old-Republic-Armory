REGARDING MODELS:
    ALL MODELS ARE LICENSED UNDER CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION 4.0 INTERNATIONAL: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

    You are free to use, edit, and redistribute any of our model files under the following conditions:
        1. You give proper credit to Moose in your workshop description, and preferably link back to his sketchfab page. He's breaking the Arma mod scene's typical no-derivatives trend (especially in the SW community) to help us expand the SWTOR mod ecosystem. The least we could do is give him credit for his work when we use it.
        2. You abide by the terms and conditions of the licensed material (e.g. no monetization)

    Raw model files can be found on Moose's sketchfab page (provided above). If you're lazy, you can debinarize our *.p3d files using this tool by Crip12 (https://github.com/Crip12/P3D-Debinarizer-Arma-3/releases).

REGARDING TEXTURES:
    You are free to use, edit, and redistribute any of our texture files so long as you abide by the terms of the Arma Public License as defined in the root LICENSE file.

REGARDING EVERYTHING ELSE:
    Go crazy and change whatever; I don't care. My code is dog so if you wanna change it then by all means go right ahead.

DISCLAIMERS:

* Failure to follow these honestly pretty basic rules can/will result in your mod being taken off the workshop. We will contact you in advance in most cases, unless you are blatantly selling freeware assets or something. 

* We are not lawyers nor do we have a specialized Star Wars drama lawyer on retainer. I have no clue how half this stuff works, but I'm pretty sure the IP and rights to every Star Wars mod technically belong to Disney. They have multiple Star Wars drama lawyers on retainer so please don't do anything stupid like resell assets or blindly threaten legal action because someone reused your resused assets from a mod that reuses a whole IP from Disney.

If you have any questions about the mod, or about modding the mod, feel free to leave a comment on the workshop page and we'll get back to you ASAP. Good luck!
