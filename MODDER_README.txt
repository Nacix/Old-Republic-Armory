DISCLAIMERS:

* Failure to follow these stupidly relaxed rules can/will result in you being yelled at really meanly. Candidly speaking, we can't really do a whole lot other than that since SW mods are in a gray area with Disney's licensing and we technically don't hold the IP. 
  Since issuing DMCAs requires one to be the owner of the Intellectual Property they protect, there is a chance that DMCA takedowns would be seen as perjury. To avoid such issues, we'll be trying to foster a more open-ended content structure rather than directly policing the use of our assets.
  We may, however, report your mod to the Steam Workshop moderation team for violation of the Workshop Terms and Conditions in the case of reuploads. All we ask is that you give credit where it is due, so we really hope this won't become an issue.

* With all that being said, the individual authors of our assets may still reserve the right to issue a DMCA if their licenses are violated. I can only speak concretely for the mod itself.

* We are not lawyers nor do we have a specialized Star Wars drama lawyer on retainer. I have no clue how half this stuff works, but I'm pretty sure Disney might as well own us given their licensing terms. They have multiple Star Wars drama lawyers on retainer, 
  so please don't do anything stupid like monetize assets or blindly threaten "legal" action because someone reused your resused assets from a mod that reuses a whole IP from Disney.

If you have any questions about the mod, or about modding the mod, feel free to hit us up in our Discord server or Workshop page and we'll get back to you ASAP. Good luck!
